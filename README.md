## What we need from a programming site
### Agents
Will have the following functions:
- draw: Will draw the actual content
- drawDebug: Will contain everything we need for debugging
- update: Will move the object and do other stuff according to mebahvour

#### Perception
We will define perception with 3 parameters:
- Radius
- Starting angle
- End angle

Angle 0 is straight up of the character, then we have two for left and right
